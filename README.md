# AS5047-Hall-Encoder-Module
Mini breakout Board for the AS5047 Hall Encoder chip. Works with Vesc

(pcb/schematic pictures)

this project is made with kicad nightly 5.99. if it doesn't open with the latest kicad version, it will with `Version: (5.99.0-9885-g7a8abcadd2), release build`

if you hate crimping, there are prebuilt pigtails you can use to make short runs or cut up to make your own cable.

# mounting:
 I recommend using nylon m3 screws. like ((xxlinkxxx)). steel screws may disrupt the magnetic feild and affect sensing. they also are non conductive and non marring. while the pcb has been designed to route signals away from under both sides of the screw holes, ther copper ground plane is still present under the screws. screws can be mounted from either side of the board. if mounting directly to metal, it is recommended to put a nylon washer or other piece of plastic between the metal and pcb.

if you have access to a 3d printer. designing a 3d printed mount for this board is likely the easiest route if there is nalready not a good mounting loccation.
provide a example 3d printed mount for each side?
